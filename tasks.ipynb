    "## Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "\n",
    "An event in Fisher's life led him to design this experiment, His friend's future wife, Muriel Bristol, said that she could tell if the tea or the milk was put first into a cup. She was given eight cups, four of them created each way and given to her in random order. Fisher wanted to find the probability that she could say the order of addition to the cup. In the end, Muriel correctly identified which of the four cups of tea had milk poured before the tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "Suppose the Lady Tasting Tea experiment is altered to involve twelve cups of tea. Six have the milk in first and the other six having tea in first. A person claims that they have the special power of being able to tell if the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.\n",
    "1.\tCalculate, using Python, the probability that they select the correct six cups.\n",
    "Suppose, now, you are willing to accept one error. Once they select the six cups they think had the milk in first, you will give them the benefit of the doubt should they have selected at least five of the correct cups.\n",
    "2.\tCalculate the probability, assuming they have no special powers, that the person makes at most one error.\n",
    "3.\tWould you accept two errors? Explain.\n",

    "We have some assumptions to take into account for this test, we do this to try to ensure we taken out the element of chance and we are relying on statistical derivation. \n",
    "1. The lady is just guessing which way the milk was poured and cannot tell either way. This will follow the null hypothesis as her having np ability to tell the difference\n",
    "2. Once a cup has been selected, it is not put back into the selection so it cannot be chosen twice or more times\n",
    "3. It doesn't matter what way she does it, but she has to correctly state which way the milk was poured from her choice of 6 cups   from the 12.\n",
    "4. We assume that she can tell the difference."
